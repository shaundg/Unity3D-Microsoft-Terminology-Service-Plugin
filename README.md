# Unity3D-Microsoft-Terminology-Service-Plugin
A Unity3D plugin for querying the Microsoft Terminology Service for common phrases that have been localized in their product offerings

This will allow a user to query from phrases instead of isolated words. The service retrieves results from Microsoft products that have 
localized, not a simple word translation.
